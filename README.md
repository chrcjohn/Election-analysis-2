Challenge overview
The challenge was figuring out how to read and write files in Python. Also, I had to use a Python data structure to simplify the approach.

##  Summary
Files can be searched using the 'with' and 'open' commands
The CSV package allows you to get the contents of a file into a list of lists.
Use candidate level information stored in a dictionary to determine the winner later
Use conditions and loops for decision
